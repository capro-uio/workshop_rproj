    "text": "Workshop progression\nIn this section, we have anything that is related to the workshop as it is progressing. Each section has its own subtitle here, and these should also match sections in the collaborative document. This way, helpers can easily navigate to the relevant section in the helper document.\n\nEduCloud flavour\nThis section is only when we run the course on EduCloud.\nThe project for the course i ec306, but that does not really matter. We wont by default be using the project space.\nLearners will first go to open on demand, and start an RStudio server https://ondemand.educloud.no/pun/sys/dashboard\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe introduction is meant to provide a basis of what we will be talking about during the workshop, to set expectations and provide everyone with an equal frame of reference.\nAt the end there is an exercise to get people to explore their R installation and get familiarized with it.\n\nExercise: Explore your R installation\nLearners should run this code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_course(\"rstats-wtf/wtf-explore-libraries\")\n\nThe exercise is singular, but has three flavours (as most exercises for this course has).\n\nsolution: provides the solution to the exercise, for novices\ncomfy: provides example code to run, for intermediates\nspartan: provides no example code, for experts\n\nI will always walk through the solution once the exercise is done.\n\n\n\nProject Oriented workflow\nThis section is about what project oriented workflows are and why we should adopt them. There are a fair few links to various important resources, that learners might want into the collaborative document, if they don’t have the slides up while we instruct.\nIf they ask for them, please do copy them in.\nThe exercise is to create a new project, in the folder they downloaded in the previous exercise. Meaning, they should create a project in an existing folder, either through the RStudio GUI, or through the R console.\nThey need to change this path to where the folder is usethis::create_project(\"/path/to/folder\")\nOR do\nFile -&gt; New Project -&gt; Existing Directory\n\n\nFile naming\nThis section is all about names, and here we have no exercises, but rather some verbal discussion and shout-outs to the slides. Here the focus is to get them thinking about what file names are good and why some file names are worse.\n\n\nProject Structure\nIn the project structure section, we talk about what constitutes a good project structure. There is no singular correct answer to this, but there are guidelines that are good to discuss and talk about.\nMostly we here talk about how splitting a project into several parts is better than having one large singular script.\nIn this exercise at the end, they are again instructed to download some exercise materials. This time, they should read the README for further instructions on what they should be doing during the exercise.\n\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n# saves project on desktop by default for most users\nuse_course(\"rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report\")\n# use_course(\"rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report\", destdir = \"my/new/location\")\n# can alternatively download from \n# https://github.com/rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report\n\nThey should familiarise themselves with the project structure and how its set up. Then run sequentially through the three exercises in the R/ folder. The expectation here is that most people will not be able to finish it all during the time allotted, but that is fine. We just have enough material so even experts can feel challenged.\n\n\nPackage management\nThis section is all about package management, and how to manage packages in a project. This is by far the most advanced subject we are covering, and I expect some to feel a little overwhelmed. Nonetheless, this is a section a lot of people really appreciate, and even novices will be able to take away things to remember in the future when they get more comfortable. Package management is a known sore point for R users, particularly on shared resources like educloud!\nHere we talk about why package management in R can be tricky, and why we should care, and offer the current best practice solution.\nThe exercise here is a little different than what we have done before. It still contains the three flavours, but requires the learners to\n\ngo through the exercises,\nmake a note of the results,\nthen initiate the package manager,\nredo the exercise, noting the difference between the two\n\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n# saves project on desktop by default for most users\nuse_course(\"capro-uio/wtf-explore-renv\")\n# use_course(\"capro-uio/wtf-explore-renv\", destdir = \"my/new/location\")\n# can alternatively download from \n# https://github.com/capro-uio/wtf-explore-renv\n\nHere, we want to make a point of how the package manager changes where and how packages are stored."

Researchers are capable of creating complex and impressive projects, but it is unlikely to have benefited from any formal training or mentorship related to topics regarding project management. As a result of this, reproducibility and longevity of projects are likely to suffer. Learning aspects of project management is a vital, but rarely taught, skill when working on a project. While project management has some general guidelines that traverse fields, there are specific aspects to think about when working R, given R’s idiosyncrasies."
