## Preparations

You might already have R and RStudio installed on your system. We highly recommend updating both of them to the latest version before the workshop, to ensure you can follow along all the exercises.

### Install summary

-   install/update [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)

-   install/update [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
:::

A new version of RStudio and R is recommended. Even if you have R and RStudio installed on your system, you should update all them before the workshop if you installed them longer than 2 months ago.

### R packages

In addition to R and RStudio, a series of R packages will also be needed to complete the workshop tasks.

``` r
# Run in R
install.packages(c(
  "remotes",      # installing packages from GitHub
  "rmarkdown",    # rendering reports
  "fs",           # file system operations
  "here",         # navigating paths
  "usethis",      # for course materials
  "tidyverse",    # data-wrangling
  "renv"          # package management
))
```
