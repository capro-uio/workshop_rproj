As researchers grow in their skills, eventually the infrastructure surrounding the analysis will become an important catalyst for the reproducibility and longevity of analysis artefacts. 
Researchers are capable of creating complex and impressive projects, but it is unlikely to have benefited from any formal training or mentorship related to topics regarding project management. 
As a result of this, reproducibility and longevity of projects are likely to suffer. Learning aspects of project management is a vital, but rarely taught, skill when working on a project. 
While project management has some general guidelines that traverse fields, there are specific aspects to think about when working R, given R's idiosyncrasies.
