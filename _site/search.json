Researchers are capable of creating complex and impressive projects, but it is unlikely to have benefited from any formal training or mentorship related to topics regarding project management. As a result of this, reproducibility and longevity of projects are likely to suffer. Learning aspects of project management is a vital, but rarely taught, skill when working on a project. While project management has some general guidelines that traverse fields, there are specific aspects to think about when working R, given R’s idiosyncrasies."
