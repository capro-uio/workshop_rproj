Once you click launch, a server will be queued for you\

This will launch an RStudio server for you to use, in the cloud.

## Working on EduCloud

You have the option to

-   work in your own home directory

-   work in a project directory

    -   Under \`My Projects\` you should see any educloud project you are a member of that has on demand ready (are connected to Fox).

For this workshop, we will work on our own home spaces.
