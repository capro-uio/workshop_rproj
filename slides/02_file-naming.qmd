## Names machines like {.smaller}

1.  don't leave white space

. . .

2.  use letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores... that's it <br> (characters like \^.\*?+\|\$ can have a special meaning)

. . .

3.  be consistent with case <br> (some operating systems treat a and A the same, some differently).

. . .

4.  use separator characters wisely

    use underscore `_` to separate different chunks

    use hyphen `-` for words in the same chunk

. . .

<br>

This creates names that are regular expression and globbing friendly, and easy to compute on! 🎉

## Names humans like

<br>

name contains info on content

name anticipates context

concept of a slug 🐌 from user-friendly URLs

-   1986-01-28\_`raw-data-from-challenger-o-rings`.txt

-   concise, meaningful description

-   usually appended to the end

::: notes
Note: A URL slug is the part of the URL after the last backslash - important for keyword SEO

## Names that sort nicely

<br>

put something numeric in there

left pad with zeros for constant width, nice sorting, `01`

use the ISO 8601 standard for dates, `YYYY-MM-DD`

order = chronological or ... consider common sense

## ISO 8601

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.column width="4%"}

::: {.column width="56%"}

## 👍 file names {.center-x}

![](img/file-names-01.png)

. . .

Anyone can guess at file's purpose

## 👍 file names {.center-x}

![](img/file-names-02.png)

Easy to filter in R (or the shell or whatever)

## 👍 file names {.center-x}

![](img/file-names-03.png)

Intentional delimiters means meta-data is easily recovered.

`_` delimits fields; `-` delimits words

## 👍 file names {.center-x}

![](img/file-names-04.png)

Sorts in the same order as you <br> experience in real life.

## Names matter

<br>

machine readable, human readable, and sort nicely

<br>

. . .

easy to implement NOW

<br>

payoffs accumulate as your skills evolve and <br> projects get more complex
